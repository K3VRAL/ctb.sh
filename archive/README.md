This is the old website where everything was done statically or code from the new website that doesn't really work at the moment.
Take everything with a grain of salt as it is poorly programmed with the the mind of only doing everything statically or just plain broken code.
Archiving and using this as a reference frame for consistency or just thrown to the side if I want to one day use the code for later.
Please ignore.
