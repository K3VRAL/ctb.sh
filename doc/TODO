TODO

Do the actual documentation with each page having their own explainations and examples, stop being lazy.

Use mariadb/mysql to store data of:
    - Rankings/Mod Rankings

Map out how the SQL databases will work

Make documentation to use:
    - .env
    - mysql/mariadb

Idea for verifying that might not work; get code after user authenticates,
use code to get oauth then eventually /me/fruits from osu api and see if pp is above 2500.
If so, then they are qualified to edit data on the website so store a cookie that will expire after 24 hours.
Once the cookie expires or is just not generally in where the cookies should be at, the website will ask for the user
to reauthenticate again through osu again.
THE DATA STORED IN MYSQL WILL BE (fuck now I don't know how to store relevant data without storing the private ones)
